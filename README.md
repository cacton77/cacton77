### Welcome to My GitHub ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Colin! I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a voracious learner, an attentive listener, and I jump at any opportunity to seek solutions to engineering problems. 

I am looking to start my professional career in a collaborative environment where I can exercise my creativity, apply my technical knowledge, and develop new skills. I am most excited by bold projects that positively impact people. Environmental conservation has played an important role in my life as my initial inspiration for pursuing a career in engineering.

My work experience has involved building virtual factory networks, applying lean manufacturing techniques to automation problems, and training a wide range of employees to operate new, technical tools. I have a humanistic approach to engineering and consider my writing, communication, and teamwork skills vital to my personal success as an engineer.

At Berkeley, I rigorously explored many disciplines of Mechanical Engineering from robotics, controls, and mechatronics design to materials engineering, modeling, and simulation. I am talented at visualization, and have honed my mechanical design skills in PTC Creo (my favorite!), SolidWorks, and AutoCAD on projects like an Autonomous Sailboat, a Basketball-Shooting Robot, and a Record Player.
