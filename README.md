### Hi, my name is Colin. Welcome to my engineering portfolio!

## Mechatronics Design Projects

### [Autonomous Sailboat](https://github.com/cacton77/Autonomous-Sailboat)

Years ago, while teaching sailing on Lake Washington, I dreamed of a sailboat that could gracefully react to shifting winds and navigate between points without a crew. For my capstone mechatronics design course at Berkeley I got the chance to lead a team of my peers in realizing this dream.

Things I learned from this project:

* Designing custom systems and selecting parts according to load specifications
* Designing and 3D Printing parts for a custom sensor
* Integrating multiple sensors into a subsystem used for control of an airfoil
* Communication between I2C and SPI devices and microprocessors

### ![Basketball Shooting Robot](https://github.com/cacton77/Basketball-Shooting-Robot)

This final project for an upper-division mechanical design course tasked us with designing and building a PSoC 5LP based device, implementing real-time programming and multitasking in our code and controlling the robot with a LabView VI. Our basketball shooting robot was able to autonomously detect and shoot a ball into a full-size hoop.

I learned a lot from this project:

* Designing finite-state machines and creating state transition diagrams
* Real-time programming using interrupts
* Multitasking to perform multiple functions "at the same time."
* Receiving and transmitting data between UART devices and microprocessors
* Using LiDAR to detect objects and record distances
* Experimentally determining optimum parameters for trajectory calculations
