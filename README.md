## Mechatronics Design Projects

### [Autonomous Sailboat](https://github.com/cacton77/Autonomous-Sailboat) :sailboat:

Years ago, while teaching sailing on Lake Washington, I dreamed of a sailboat that could gracefully react to shifting winds and navigate between points. For my capstone mechatronics design course at Berkeley I got the chance to lead a team of my peers in realizing this dream.
