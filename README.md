### Hi, my name is Colin. Welcome to my engineering portfolio!

## Mechatronics Design Projects

### [Autonomous Sailboat](https://github.com/cacton77/Autonomous-Sailboat) :sailboat:

Years ago, while teaching sailing on Lake Washington, I dreamed of a sailboat that could gracefully react to shifting winds and navigate between points without a crew. For my capstone mechatronics design course at Berkeley I got the chance to lead a team of my peers in realizing this dream.

Things I learned from this project:

* System architecture design based on power and mechanical load requirements
* Selecting servos, bearings, and materials according to load specifications
* Designing and 3D Printing parts for a custom sensor
* Integrating multiple sensors into a subsystem used for control of an airfoil
* Writing firmware for communication between I2C and SPI devices and microprocessors

### ![Basketball Shooting Robot](https://github.com/cacton77/Basketball-Shooting-Robot) :robot:

This final project for an upper-division mechanical design course tasked us with designing and building a PSoC 5LP based device, implementing real-time programming and multitasking in our code and controlling the robot with a LabView VI. Our basketball shooting robot was able to autonomously detect and shoot a ball into a full-size hoop.

I learned a lot from this project:

* Designing finite-state machines and creating state transition diagrams
* Creating map files to select and configure hardware components of a PSoC 5LP using register schematics and peripheral protocols
* Writing and documenting code to collect and interpret UART LiDAR data packets, perform edge detection, and calculate a trajectory
* Real-time programming using interrupts
* Using multitasking to read sensor data and control motors while receiving state transition commands from a LabVIEW GUI via USB

### Model and Animation of music hall usb-1 Turntable :notes:

In this project we modeled all 140+ parts of a turntable using PTC Creo and animated the assembly and functionality of the system and subsystems using 3ds MAX. Currently the file for our final video is missing, but I have a clip of the exploded view.

## Simulation and Optimization

One of my favorite classes in my undergraduate career at Berkeley was Modeling and Simulation Tools for Industrial Research. This class required us to apply all of our knowledge accumulated from mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, solid mechanics, E&M, etc. to create models in MATLAB of advanced real world problems. We applied Genetic Algorithms to these simulations to optimize design parameters according to desired behaviors. Here is a small selection of the projects I did and the reports I wrote in this class.
